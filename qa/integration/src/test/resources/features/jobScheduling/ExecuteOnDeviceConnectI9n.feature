  Scenario: Executing Job When Device Connected After The Specified Start Date And Time
  Login as the kapua-sys user and create a new job with a Command Execution job step.
  Define a new "Device Connect" schedule and add it to the created job.
  The schedule should have a start date in the past and no defined end date.
  Add a previously disconnected KuraMock device as the job target.
  After the restart of the KuraMock device the job should be started.
  The execution of the job should be confirmed, the job targets step index should be
  0 and status PROCESS_OK.

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I start the Kura Mock

    Then Device status is "DISCONNECTED" within 10 seconds
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock device after 5 seconds
    When I search for events from device "rpione3" in account "kapua-sys" I find 2 events within 30 seconds
