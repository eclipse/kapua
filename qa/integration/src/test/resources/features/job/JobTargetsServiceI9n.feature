Feature: Job Target service CRUD tests
    The Job service is responsible for maintaining a list of job targets.

Scenario: Regular target creation

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
        | type    | name                       | value |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |
    And I configure the job target service
        | type    | name                       | value |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job target item
    Then No exception was thrown
    And The job target matches the creator
    Then I logout

Scenario: Target with a null scope ID

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
        | type    | name                       | value |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |
    And I configure the job target service
        | type    | name                       | value |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |
    Given A null scope
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "scopeId"
    When I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    Then An exception was thrown
    Then I logout

Scenario: Delete a job target

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"

        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job target item
    When I delete the last job target in the database
    And I search for the last job target in the database
    Then There is no such job target item in the database
    Then I logout

        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job target item
    When I delete the last job target in the database
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaEntityNotFoundException" with the text "type jobTarget"
    When I delete the last job target in the database
    Then An exception was thrown
    Then I logout
