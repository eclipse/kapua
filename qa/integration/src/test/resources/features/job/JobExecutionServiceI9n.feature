Feature: Job Execution service CRUD tests
    The Job service is responsible for maintaining the status of the target step executions.

@setup
Scenario: Init Security Context for all scenarios
    Given Init Security Context
  And Start base docker environment

Scenario: Regular job execution creation

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
        | type    | name                       | value |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job execution item
    Then No exception was thrown
    And The job execution matches the creator

Scenario: Update job id of an existing execution item

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
        | type    | name                       | value |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job execution item
    Then I create a job with the name "TestJob2"
    When I update the job id for the execution item
    Then No exception was thrown

Scenario: Update the end time of an existing execution item

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
        | type    | name                       | value |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job execution item
    When I update the end time of the execution item
    Then No exception was thrown
    When I search for the last job execution in the database
    Then The job execution items match

Scenario: Delete a job execution item

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
        | type    | name                       | value |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job execution item
    Then I delete the last job execution in the database
    When I search for the last job execution in the database
    Then There is no such job execution item in the database

Scenario: Delete a job execution item twice

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
        | type    | name                       | value |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job execution item
    Then I delete the last job execution in the database
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaEntityNotFoundException" with the text "jobExecution"
    Then I delete the last job execution in the database
    Then An exception was thrown

Scenario: Create and count several execution items for a job

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
        | type    | name                       | value |

    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job execution item
    And A regular job execution item
    And A regular job execution item
    And A regular job execution item
    Then No exception was thrown
    When I count the execution items for the current job
    Then I count 4

Scenario: Query for executions of a specific job

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
