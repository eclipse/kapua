  Scenario: Restarting a job with valid Configuration Put step two times
  Create a new job and set a connected KuraMock device as the job target.
  Add a new valid Configuration Put step to the created job. Restart the job two times.
  After the executed job is finished, the executed target's step index should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_OK

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I start the Kura Mock
    When Device is connected within 10 seconds
    And I wait 1 second
    Then Device status is "CONNECTED" within 10 seconds
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock device after 5 seconds
    Then Configuration is requested
    And A Configuration named "org.eclipse.kura.clock.ClockService" has property "clock.ntp.retry.interval" with value "5"
    When I search for events from device "rpione3" in account "kapua-sys" I find 2 events within 30 seconds
    And The type of the last event is "CONFIGURATION"
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And I create a new job target item
    And Search for step definition with the name "Configuration Put"
    And I prepare a JobStepCreator with the name "TestStep" and the following properties

  Create a new job and set a connected KuraMock devices as the job targets.
  Add a new valid Package Uninstall and valid Asset Write steps to the created job.
  Restart the job two times. After the executed job is finished, the executed target's
  step index should be 1 and the status PROCESS_OK
