Feature: JobEngineService tests for restarting job with offline device

  Scenario: Set environment variables
    Given System property "broker.ip" with value "localhost"
    And System property "commons.db.connection.host" with value "localhost"

  Scenario: Start event broker for all scenarios
    Given Start Event Broker

  Scenario: Start broker for all scenarios
    Given Start Broker

    # * Restarting a job with one Target and one Step *
    # *************************************************

  Scenario: Restarting job with Command Execution step
  Create a new job and set a disconnected KuraMock device as the job target.
  Add a new Asset Write step to the created job. Restart the job before starting.
  After the executed job is finished, the executed target's step index should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_FAILED.

    Given I start the Kura Mock
    And Device is connected
    And I wait 1 second
    Then Device status is "CONNECTED"

  Scenario: Restarting job with Command Execution and Bundle Start steps and multiple devices
  Create a new job. Set a disconnected Kura Mock devices as a job targets.
  Add a new Command Execution and Bundle Start steps to the created job. Restart the job.
  After the executed job is finished, the step index of executed targets should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_FAILED.
