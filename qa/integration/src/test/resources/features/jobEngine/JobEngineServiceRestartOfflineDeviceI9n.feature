    # * Restarting a job with one Target and one Step *
    # *************************************************

  Scenario: Restarting job with Command Execution step
  Create a new job and set a disconnected KuraMock device as the job target.
  Add a new Asset Write step to the created job. Restart the job before starting.
  After the executed job is finished, the executed target's step index should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_FAILED.

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I start the Kura Mock
    And Device is connected within 10 seconds
    And I wait 1 second
    Then Device status is "CONNECTED" within 10 seconds
    When KuraMock is disconnected
    And I wait 1 second
    Then Device status is "DISCONNECTED" within 10 seconds
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock device after 5 seconds
    And I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A new job target item
    And Search for step definition with the name "Command Execution"
    And I prepare a JobStepCreator with the name "TestStep" and the following properties

    Then No exception was thrown
    When I restart a job
    And I query for the job with the name "TestJob" and I count 1 execution item and I confirm the executed job is finished within 20 seconds
    And I search for the last job target in the database
    Then I confirm the step index is 0 and status is "PROCESS_FAILED"
    And I logout

  Scenario: Restarting job with Command Execution and Bundle Start steps and multiple devices
  Create a new job. Set a disconnected Kura Mock devices as a job targets.
  Add a new Command Execution and Bundle Start steps to the created job. Restart the job.
  After the executed job is finished, the step index of executed targets should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_FAILED.
