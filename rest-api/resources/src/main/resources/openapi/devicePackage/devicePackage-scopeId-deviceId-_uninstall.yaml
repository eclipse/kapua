            The Package Install request has been successfully received. However, this does NOT mean that the package has been successfully installed, since the Package Install
            is an asynchronous operation and may still be in progress. APIs are available at `device/{deviceId}/operations` and `device/{deviceId}/operations/{operationId}/notifications`
            to track asynchronous operations.
