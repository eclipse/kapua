            An object that holds all the informations pertaining an Account, including the details about the Contacts of that account.\
            In Kapua an Account is the container of all other resources (Users, Devices, etc.), and is the equivalent of the concept of Tenant.\
            Every entity in Kapua will have a `scopeId` property, that holds the ID of the Account who holds that entity.
